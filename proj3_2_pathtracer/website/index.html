<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Use this section to write an overview of the assignment. All of the text in your write-up should be <em>in your own words</em>. If you need to add additional HTML features to this document, you can search the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com/</a> website for instructions. To edit the HTML, you can just copy and paste existing chunks and fill in the text and image file names appropriately.</p>
<p>The website writeup is intended to be a self-contained walkthrough of the assignment: we want this to be a piece of work which showcases your understanding of relevant concepts through both mesh images as well as written explanations about what you did to complete each part of the assignment. Try to be as clear and organized as possible when writing about your own output files or extensions to the assignment. We want to understand what you've achieved and how you've done it!</p>
<p>If you are well-versed in web development, feel free to ditch this template and make a better looking page. Just make sure that you include all the components as we've laid them out here. </p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>

  <div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
        <td align="middle">
        <img src="images/example_image.png" width="480px" />
        <figcaption align="middle">Results Caption: my bunny is the bounciest bunny</figcaption>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>Here is an example of how to include a simple formula:</p>
  <p align="middle"><pre align="middle">a^2 + b^2 = c^2</pre></p>
  <p>or, alternatively, you can include an SVG image of a LaTex formula.</p>
